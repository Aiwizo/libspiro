LibSpiro is a shared library designed to give programs the ability to create
smooth continuous curves based on a given set of codes and X,Y constraints.

The main user(s) of Libspiro are Font editing programs such as FontForge,
and forked copies have been seen in more artistic programs such as InkScape,
or in libraries such as GEGL. There may be other possible uses in future.

Developers interested in also sharing and making use of LibSpiro will likely
want to read (in this order to understand LibSpiro better):
README-RaphLevien
README-GeorgeWilliams

There is a large amount of information and math on RaphLevien's website for
developers interested in how LibSpiro works.

Developers interested in example programs, can take a look at spiro.c found
within FontForge, InkScape, GEGL and call-test.c included with this library.
